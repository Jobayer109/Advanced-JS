        A. Normal function declaration (addition, subtraction operation)


    Notes:
    ------
      1. In JavaScript, functions are indeed objects.

      2. This is one of the unique and powerful features of the language.

      3. Functions in JavaScript are first-class objects. It can be -----
          * Assigned to variables, properties, or array elements.
          * Passed as arguments to other functions.
          * Returned from other functions.
          * Created dynamically at runtime.
          
      4. Function expressions (normal expressions / arrow function) and declarations 
         serve the same purpose, but their use-cases differ. While function 
         declarations are hoisted, making them callable before their declaration, 
         function expressions arenâ€™t. Knowing when to use which is crucial for clean 
         code.

      5. Functions are always hoisted first. In whatever order the declarations of a 
         function and a variable with the same name occur in your code, the function 
         takes precedence, because it rises higher.
          
          Example is written below ----|>

// --------------------------------------------------------------------------->>

// addition numbers
function add(a, b) {
  const result = a + b;
  //   console.log(result);
}
add(5, 9); // 14
add(12, 20); // 32

// -------------------------->>

// subtraction number:
function sub(a, b) {
  const result = a - b;
  return result;
}
const res1 = sub(12, 8); // 4
const res2 = sub(58, 8); // 50
