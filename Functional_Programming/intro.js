Q: What is functional programming ?

    Functional programming is programming paradigm (স্বর্গ) - where a style of building 
    the structure and element of computer program that treats computation as the 
    evaluation of mathematical functions and avoid  changing-state and mutable 
    (পরিবর্তনযোগ্য) data.

    Or,
    Functional programming is a programming paradigm in which we try to bind everything 
    in pure mathematical functions style. It is a declarative type of programming style. 
    Its main focus is on “what to solve” in contrast to an imperative style where the 
    main focus is “how to solve”.

    Three main terms:
        1. Pure function.
        2. First class  function
        3. Higher order  function

     
     ---->> Function acts like a value (Definition)

    Notes:
        * It uses expressions instead of statements. An expression is evaluated to
          produce a value; whereas a statement is executed to assign variables. 
        * Functional Programming is based on Lambda Calculus: 
          Lambda calculus is a framework developed by Alonzo Church to study 
          computations with functions.
        * It can be called as the smallest programming language in the world.
